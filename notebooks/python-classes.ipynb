    "## Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen that Python supports procedural programming, breaking up the code into functions, and calling them in a linear flow of control.   Python also supports a functional programming paradigm, where functions are first class objects and can take other functions as parameters.   It shouldn't be too much of a surprise that Python also supports object oriented programming as well, where we define a `class` with data/attributes and behavior/methods.  A class ia a template for `objects` which interact with each other and mimic real world constructs, a `Person`, an `Account`, etc.\n"

The first parameter of the method `self` refers to the instance of the class itself and does not need to be passed by you.  `self` is a hidden parameter passed to all **instance methods** as the first argument.  If it is helpful, think of the object instance (`employee` above) as the first argument, the object iself. \n",

There are many more dunder methods for every class and these methods, typically allow you to hook into the Python object model and make the object behave `Pythonically` if that is a word.  And, of course, who doesn't want their object to behave Pythonically ?!?!"
