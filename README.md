# Slice-o-py

Python training/learning materials for everyone

## Setup

You'll first need to create a virtual environment

    $ python -m venv .venv --prompt=my-env
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    (my-env) $

then install the dependencies

    (my-env) $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## Notebooks 

To run a jupyter notebook (or jupyter lab) simply issue the command

    (my-env) $ jupyter lab

this should open in your default browser but it also prints a link which you
can copy and paste into a browser window.  Then open any of the notebooks
in the `notebook` directory.


When you are finished with the environment, you can deactivate it

    (my-env) $ deactivate
    $

or simply close the terminal.   NOTE: It is also possible to edit and run the
notebook in [PyCharm Professional](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), if you
own a license to it.
